## The goal

The goal of this script is to let you completely export your content hosted on Tumblr to plain Markdown files.

It downloads and converts “text”, “photo”, “video”, “link”, and “quote” post bodies. It optionally also downloads images from Tumblr into your local storage. I have built and tested it to migrate from Tumblr to Octopress, but it may have other uses as well.

I found a bunch of Tumblr exporters online, but they were mainly dealing with published site content that was already preprocessed. I did not find any exporters based on Tumblr API, so I decided to write one. Kudos to Tumblr for having a well-defined API and Python wrapper that were a joy to work with in this project. The API seems to enable unlimited data import and export. I can only wish that all products had such a great API.

## Prerequisites

Requires [py2tumblr.](https://github.com/tumblr/pytumblr)

## How to use

Just run it with -h switch.

	jaanus-mbp:tumblr2markdown jaanus$ ./tumblr2markdown.py -h

	                        If downloading images, store them to this local path,
	                        by default “images”

	This app downloads all your Tumblr content into Markdown files that are
	suitable for processing with Octopress. Optionally also downloads the images
	hosted on Tumblr and replaces their URLs with locally hosted versions.

You will need a Tumblr API key, which you can get by [registering a Tumblr application.](http://www.tumblr.com/oauth/apps) Get the value called called “OAuth Consumer Key”.
